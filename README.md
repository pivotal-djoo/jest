# Jest Sample Project

Sample project using React + Parcel + Typescript + Jest

## Run Application

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn dev 
```

After running the above command, open [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) on a browser.

## Run Unit Tests

Uses [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

```
yarn test
```

## Run Lint

Runs eslint. Also attempts to compile using TSC, since Parcel does not perform any type checking. Lint step should be a part of CI.

```
yarn lint
```
